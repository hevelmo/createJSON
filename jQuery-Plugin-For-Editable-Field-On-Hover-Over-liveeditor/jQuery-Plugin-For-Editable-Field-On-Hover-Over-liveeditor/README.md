liveeditor
==========

jQuery plugin that displays input editors when the user hovers over an editable control.

The latest minified version is compressed with YUI Compressor 2.4.8 using http://refresh-sf.com/yui/

	1.0.0 - The LiveEditor is well tested and considered stable. 
				Added getIndexes(), followIndexes() and getName() to simplify tree traversals.
				Removed the .debug version of LiveEditor since it made more harm than use once it is stable.
				Added a .map file that helps when stepping into the .min file instead.
    0.9.1 - Minor bugfix when user tries to fetch value from a field with an open editor.
    0.9.0 - $.liveeditor.serializeRow(row, headerRow, index) injects the index into the controls name if needed, 
                ie. "item[].id" => "item[0].id"
    0.8.1 - Fixed bug when filling options in comboboxes.
    0.8.0 - When LiveEditor is initialized it can populate checkboxes and comboboxes with their correct html based
                on the objects value property. Set the option fillControls = true to enable this feature.
    0.7.0 - Added function $.liveeditor.isEnabled() to test if a certain field is enabled or disabled.
                Also fixed incompatibilities with jQuery 1.10.2. Previous version was just tested on jQuery 1.7.1
    0.6.1 - $.liveeditor.reset() no longer calls onChanged(). It was a bad design decision that caused more problems than it solved.
    0.6.0 - Editor now cancels changes when hovering and leaving an editor or pressing ESC key, 
               rather than committing the old value. Important for comboboxes with missing values for example.
            Also added method $.liveeditor.serializeRow() for improved serialization of the special case of datagrids.
            Fixed minor bugfixes.
    0.5.0 - Fixed bug when calling event onSetValue. 
            Also fixed bug when committing editors the plugin could mistake inner html for being an editor and crash.
    0.4.0 - Added editingCss option for improved skinning.
    0.3.0 - get() and serialize() public functions added for simple value retrieval by the page logic.
    0.2.0 - set() and reset() functions operates on selectors instead of single elements.
            Fixed major bug in reset().
    0.1.0 - Initial release.
